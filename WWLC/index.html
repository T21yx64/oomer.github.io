<td height="50" valign="middle"><strong>Bycatch: <br />
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever there is fishing, there is bycatch - the incidental capture of  non-target species such as dolphins, marine turtles and seabirds. Despite new  technologies and industry recognition of the issue, bycatch is still a major  problem. Not only does it cause avoidable deaths and injuries, but the fishing  methods can be harmful to the marine environments where they are employed. We aim  to reduce bycatch by working with fisheries and helping develop and promote new  technologies and gear for more efficient operations.<br /></td>

  <td height="68" valign="middle" ><strong>Climate Change</strong>:<br />
  Sea  levels are rising and oceans are becoming warmer. Longer, more intense droughts  threaten crops, wildlife and freshwater supplies. From polar bears in the  Arctic to marine turtles off the coast of Africa, our planet's diversity of  life is at risk from the changing climate. To adequately address this crisis we must urgently  reduce carbon pollution and prepare for the consequences of global warming,  which we are already experiencing. We should be able to make advance policies to fight climate change, engage with businesses to reduce carbon emissions  and help people and nature to adapt to a changing climate.</td>

  <td height="68" valign="middle" ><strong>Deforestation:<br />
  </strong>Deforestation  comes in many forms, including fires, clear-cutting for agriculture, ranching  and development, unsustainable logging for timber, and degradation due to climate  change. This impacts people's livelihood and threatens a wide range of plant  and animal species. Forests play a critical role in mitigating climate change  because they act as a carbon sink- soaking up carbon dioxide that would  otherwise be free in the atmosphere and contribute to ongoing changes in  climate patterns. We focus on protected areas management and sustainable forestry to  promote certification for responsible forest management practices, combat  illegal logging, reform trade policies and protect forested areas.</td>

  <td height="68" valign="middle" ><strong>Illegal Wild Life Trade:<br />
  </strong>The  world is dealing with an unprecedented spike in illegal wildlife trade,  threatening to overturn decades of conservation gains. Ivory estimated to weigh  more than 23 metric tons-a figure that represents 2,500 elephants- were seized in  the 13 largest seizures of illegal ivory in 2011. Poaching threatens the last  of our wild tigers that number as few as 3,200.Wildlife crime is a big  business. Run by dangerous international networks, wildlife and animal parts  are trafficked much like illegal drugs and arms. Stamping out wildlife crime  is our first pirority because it is the largest direct  threat to the future of many of the world's most threatened species. It is  second only to habitat destruction in overall threats against species survival.</td>

  <td height="68" valign="middle" ><strong>Infrastructure</strong>:r<br />
A  road cuts through pristine rainforest to give a community access to the city. A  dam creates a reservoir to provide freshwater to a growing town. A platform  that is miles from the shoreline gives access to oil reserves deep below the  ocean floor. These are all examples of infrastructure-physical structures that  provide the underpinnings for modern society. Infrastructure is a necessary  part of the development associated with a growing human population, but it can  also have devastating impacts on the environment. The government should work on  industrial scale and encourage the consideration of sustainability in these  efforts, including examining innovative ways reduce environmental impact and  protecting sensitive habitat that may be irrevocably damaged by these projects.</td>

<td height="68" valign="middle" ><strong>Oil &amp; Gas Development</strong>:<br />
 Many  of the planet's most diverse and ecologically important areasâ€”including the  Arctic and Virunga National Park in the Congo Basin-also happen to hold large  underground deposits of oil and gas. Extracting these oil and gas deposits can  result in lasting damage to the environment. Specifically, oil and gas  exploration and development causes disruption of migratory pathways,  degradation of important animal habitats, and oil spills which can be  devastating to the animals and humans who depend on these ecosystems. The  government agencies should work on this so to resolve the issue.</td>
